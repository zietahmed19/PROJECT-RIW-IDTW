Question: What does the &quot;yield&quot; keyword do in Python?
Answer 1:
The "yield" keyword is used to create generators in Python. Generators are a type of iterator, and yield allows you to create a generator function.
Answer 2:
The "yield" keyword is used to create generator functions in Python. A generator function is a function that returns an iterator, which is a special type of object that can be used in a for loop. When a generator function is called, it doesn't actually run the code in the function body, but instead it returns a generator object. When the generator object is used in a for loop, the code in the function body is executed each time the for loop loops over the generator object
Answer 3:
The yield keyword is used to define a generator function in Python. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object. The yield keyword is used to return a value from the generator function.
Answer 4:
The yield keyword is used to define generators in Python.
Answer 5:
The "yield" keyword is used to create generators in Python. When a function containing a "yield" keyword is called, it returns a generator object.

Question: What does if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: do?

Answer 2:
This code means that the code in the if statement will only be executed if the program is run as a main program, and not if it is imported as a module.
Answer 3:
if __name__ == "__main__": tells Python that this file is the main program and should be run first.
Answer 4:
The if __name__ == "__main__": statement is used to run a Python program. It is used to check if the program is being run as a script or as a module.

Question: What does &quot;use strict&quot; do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?
Answer 1:
"use strict" is a directive that enables strict mode in JavaScript. Strict mode is a feature that allows you to write more secure and robust code by eliminating certain browser-specific behaviors that can lead to bugs and security vulnerabilities. The reasoning behind it is to make sure that code is more consistent and predictable, and to reduce the chances of errors occurring.
Answer 2:
"use strict" is a directive that tells the JavaScript interpreter to use strict mode when parsing the code. Strict mode is a way to write safer and more secure code by disabling certain features that can cause problems. The reasoning behind it is to make JavaScript more consistent and reliable.
Answer 3:
"use strict" is a directive that tells the JavaScript engine to enable strict mode. This mode makes several changes to the way the engine behaves, including disabling some features that are considered to be potentially dangerous. The goal of strict mode is to make JavaScript more reliable and secure.
Answer 4:
"use strict" is a directive that tells the JavaScript engine to enable strict mode. Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript by eliminating some of the potential risks associated with common coding errors.
Answer 5:
"use strict" is a directive that can be used at the beginning of a JavaScript file to enforce stricter parsing and error handling. The reasoning behind it is to help developers write more "secure" and "reliable" code.

Question: How do JavaScript closures work?
Answer 1:
JavaScript closures are functions that keep track of the variables that are in scope when they are defined. They then keep those variables in scope when they are invoked, even if they are invoked in a different scope.
Answer 2:
A closure is a function that makes use of variables defined in outer functions that have previously returned.
Answer 3:
A closure is a function that makes use of variables defined in outer functions that have previously returned. In JavaScript, closures are created whenever a function is created that makes use of variables from an outer function.
Answer 4:
A closure is a function that makes use of variables defined in outer functions that have previously returned. In JavaScript, closures are created whenever a function is created that makes use of variables from an outer function.
Answer 5:
A closure is a special kind of object that combines a function and the environment in which that function was created. The environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created. Closures allow functions to "remember" their surroundings.

Question: Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?
Answer 1:
When data is sorted, it is easier for the computer to find patterns and similarities. This means that the computer can process the data more quickly.
Answer 2:
When data is sorted, it is easier for the computer to find the desired piece of information. This is because the computer can use a technique called binary search to quickly locate the desired data. With unsorted data, the computer would have to search through the entire dataset, which would take significantly longer.
Answer 3:
When an array is sorted, the data is organized in a specific order. This makes it easier for the computer to find the information it needs because it can simply follow the order of the data. With an unsorted array, the computer has to search through the entire array to find the data it needs, which takes more time.
Answer 4:
When data is sorted, it is easier for the computer to find the desired information. This is because sorted data is organized in a specific order, making it easier to search through. Unsorted data, on the other hand, is not organized in any specific order, making it more difficult for the computer to find the desired information.
Answer 5:
When an array is sorted, the items in the array are in a specific order. This makes it easier and faster for the computer to access the data. When an array is unsorted, the items in the array are in no particular order. This makes it more difficult for the computer to access the data.

Question: What is the difference between String and string in C#?
Answer 1:
String is a class, and string is a primitive type.
Answer 2:
The difference between String and string in C# is that String is a reference type and string is a value type.
Answer 3:
In C#, the String class is a sealed class that represents a string data type, while the string keyword is an alias for the System.String class. Therefore, there is no difference between String and string in C#.
Answer 4:
String is an alias of System.String and is a reference type. string is a keyword and is a value type.
Answer 5:
The main difference between String and string in C# is that String is a class and string is a data type. String is a reference type while string is a value type. String can be used to store any kind of data, while string can only store characters.

Question: Case insensitive &#39;Contains(string)&#39;
Answer 1:
The 'Contains' function is case insensitive, meaning it will return true if the string contains the specified value, regardless of case.
Answer 2:
This function will return true if the string contains the specified word, regardless of case.
Answer 3:
There is no built-in function for doing a case-insensitive search for a substring within a string. However, you can easily write your own function to do this. For example:

function containsInsensitive(str, searchStr) {
  return str.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchStr.toLowerCase()) !== -1;
}
Answer 4:
Yes, the String.Contains() method is case-insensitive.
Answer 5:
The Contains() method can be used with a string, but it is not case sensitive. This means that if you are looking for a string that contains the letter "A", it will also match strings that contain the letter "a".
